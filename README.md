## (WIP) MoodSwing
A web application built with ExpressJS and React, powered by indico.io and Azure's machine learning technology. It detects your facial expression by taking snapshots of your face, and place music to suit your mood.

### Running the app

Warning: very hacky (for now)

    npm install
    npm run start OR npm run watch

Expose your webserver using an ngrok tunnel and paste the link generated by ngrok here: https://github.com/m45yang/hackthenorth2016/blob/master/controllers/image.js#L343

Create a directory named ```music/``` in the root directory of the repo, and add in songs that you would like to be played.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
